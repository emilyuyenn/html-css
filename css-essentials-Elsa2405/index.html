        For millennia brewers have taken hops, grain, yeast and water and turned
        them into flavours unique to their own place and time. Each beer - some
        rough and some refined - captured the essence of a moment. We love to
        share these moments with our guests.

        Cumberland has always been a community on the fringes, a place where
        independent thinkers could come for a fresh start and to build something
        of their own. Today it's tree planters and oil patch workers, outdoor
        enthusiasts, activists, young families, creatives, retirees, and
        tireless trail builders. At the end of the day these disparate folks
        eat, drink and come together. Growing a community is thirsty work.

          <p>
            There is a nice garden to enjoy bier and meals in a less noisy
            athmosphere - compared to the tables at the street. The plates are
            rather pricy a well, but the combo promotions including a large
            plate of food and a tower of bear are at a reasonable price. The
            food is ok and you get more than enough bear to wash it down. One
            combo is enough for 3-4 people.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the combos the price quality combination is in balance, but
            otherwise I felt the list pricy and limited.
