# Exercise 2: HTML Elements

## Objectives
Choose a website from the provided list and code the HTML for its homepage. You will use semantic HTML5 structural elements to create different groups of content. The content will include a variety of HTML content elements. An example of this exercise is provided (see folder called "example-exercise"), the example is the homepage of https://upnitlodge.ca/.

## Instructions
Remember to:
* Regularly save your files and check out what your web page looks like in a web browser.
* Make regular commits and label them appropriately.
* Read through the code provided in the example.
### Step 1: Choose a webpage
Choose a website from the list below (you will need to understand the homepage's content and think about how best to structure it using HTML structural elements):
* https://homalcotours.com/
* https://ourchildrenourway.ca/
* https://strathconaparklodge.com/
* https://spiritbear.com/
* https://visitbamfield.ca/ 
* https://kiixin.ca/
* https://cluxeweresort.com/

### Step 2: Create the website structure
* Use GitHub Desktop to clone your remote exercise repository onto your local machine.
* In VS Code, add a file called index.html to your local repository. 
* Open index.html and add the HTML skeleton code provided by VSCode.
* Add a comment in the head section of the html code including: the course code and your section number - your name - Exercise 2 - the URL of the website you chose for this exercise. Example:
`<!-- DGL 103 CVS1 - your name - Exercise 2 - https://upnitlodge.ca -->`
* Change the page title to something appropriate for the website that you chose.
* Create a folder called images.
### Step 3: Add the structural elements
Code the structural organization of the content. You may not need to use all the structural elements but you should use at least 6 of them.
1. Body 
2. Header
3. Nav
4. Main
5. Section
6. Article
7. Aside
8. Footer
### Step 4: Add the content
1. Copy and paste the content from your chosen website into your webpage.
2. Save the images in an images folder. Don't bother with background images and decorative images, only save editorial images. In the example, I didn't save the image behind the h1, nor the icons in the footer.
3. Use the elements we have learnt about so far in the lesson video and in yoru reading to organize the content:
    - Headings (H1 to H6)
    - Paragraph
    - Strong
    - Bold
    - Italic
    - Emphasis
    - Special Characters
    - Hyperlinks (including email links and same-page links)
    - Unordered lists
    - Ordered lists
    - Description lists
    - Image
    - Div and span (you shouldn't need these elements as they carry no semantic meaning and are only used to define areas to which you want to apply styling)

Many more HTML elements exist than what we have learnt so far. Research elements that make sense to use in your webpage. Make sure you use 3 or 4 new elements. 

### Step 5: Format and add comments 
* Make sure that you have the Prettier VS Code extension installed. On the index page, right-click > Format document to apply proper formatting. Repeat for the about page and the stylesheet.
* Add a few comments to explain your code, to point out any elements you have used that we haven't learnt about in class, to ask questions, or to highlight anything of interest. For ex: `<!-- I used the mark text element to highlight the word milk -->` or `<!-- I can't figure out how to write the subscribe field, should I use a form element or a an input element? -->` 

### Step 6: Check for errors
Use the VSCode HTMLHint extension and validate your code (https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_upload) to make sure that it is correct. Take a screenshot of your HTML validation results, you will need to submit it in Brightspace.

**You have now completed your exercise but you still need to push your edits to GitHub and submit it in Brightspace. Make sure to follow the instructions in the How to Complete Your Exercises Guide.**
